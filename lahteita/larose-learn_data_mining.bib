Abstract = {Learn Data Mining by doing data mining Data mining can be revolutionaryâ€”but only when it's done right. The powerful black box data mining software now available can produce disastrously misleading results unless applied by a skilled and knowledgeable analyst. Discovering Knowledge in Data: An Introduction to Data Mining provides both the practical experience and the theoretical insight needed to reveal valuable information hidden in large data sets. Employing a'white box'methodology and with real-world case studies, this step-by-step guide walks readers through the various algorithms and statistical structures that underlie the software and presents examples of their operation on actual large data sets. Principal topics include: Data preprocessing and classification Exploratory analysis Decision trees Neural and Kohonen networks Hierarchical and k-means clustering Association rules Model evaluation techniques Complete with scores of screenshots and diagrams to encourage graphical lear},
