abstract = {In bug fixing process, estimating the ‘Time to Fix Bug’ is one of the factors that helps the triager to allocate jobs in a better way. Due to the limitation of resources for bug fixing, the bugs with long fixing time must be identified, as soon as possible, after receiving the report. This helps the prioritisation and fixing process of the bug reports. In the process of bug fixing, a temporal sequence of activities is done. Each activity is represented by a term. Useful semantic information and long-term dependency are available between terms in the sequence, but it is usually underutilised by existing bug fixing time predictor approaches. This work presents a novel deep learning-based model (called DeepLSTMPred) that (i) converts constituent terms to a vector of real numbers by considering their semantic meaning, (ii) finds the long-term dependencies between terms by deep long short term memory (LSTM) and (iii) classifies sequences to short fixing time or long fixing time. DeepLSTMPred is evaluated on bug reports extracted from the Mozilla project. The results show that the proposed method has better performance in comparison with a state-of-the-art approach (that is the hidden Markov-based model). The experimental results show that DeepLSTMPred achieves 15–20\% improvement in terms of accuracy, precision, f-score, and recall.},
