  abstract={Software Analytics is gaining momentum as a result of involved empirical research in enhancing quality and productivity of software engineering activities. There have been rigorous research efforts in the areas of bug prediction and testing effort prediction by making use of historical data. The problem of predicting bug fix times is an interesting problem with lots of advantages to industry but there have been limited efforts to solve this problem. We introduce a new feature, the score of bug reporter, to predict bug fix time. The prediction accuracies of proposed model built with the new feature along with the other prominent features are found to be better than existing models.},
